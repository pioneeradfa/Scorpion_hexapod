# Scorpion Hexapod Simulator

A browser-based kinematics and gait simulator adapted from [Mithi's Bare-Minimum Hexapod Robot Simulator](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod) for the scorpion-style hexapod prototype described below. The calculations run in the browser; this project does not send commands to the physical servos.

## Prototype configuration

All model dimensions are in **millimetres**. The six coxa axes are arranged in three left/right pairs:

| Measurement | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Left-to-right coxa-axis spacing, at each station | 120 mm |
| Front-to-middle and middle-to-rear coxa-axis spacing | 115 mm each |
| Coxia link: body axis to femur axis | 64.5 mm |
| Femur link: femur axis to tibia axis | 64.5 mm |
| Tibia link: tibia axis to foot tip | 130.59 mm |

The current body parameters are `front: 60`, `middle: 60`, and `side: 115` in `src/templates/hexapodParams.js`. In this model, `front` and `middle` are offsets from the body centre (half the 120 mm spacing); `side` is the offset of the front and rear stations from the middle station.

The prototype uses 18 RDS3218 servos (three per leg, specified as 20 kg and 270°). The simulator currently has **no tail model**, as requested.

## Features

- Interactive 3D hexapod view and editable dimensions.
- Forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, leg-pose controls, and support/stability checks.
- Tripod and ripple gait options, forward/backward playback, and rotation mode.
- Gait frames are generated from Cartesian foot paths and solved through IK. If a requested stride or lift is unreachable, the solver reduces the gait amplitude until it finds a reachable sequence.
- The initial gait settings use the prototype's tripod reference values: 15° hip swing and 20° lift swing.

The body and legs are rendered as a simplified kinematic model, not as the physical CAD solids.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js and Yarn.

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

The development server normally opens at <http://localhost:3000>.

Other useful commands:

```bash
yarn test --watchAll=false --runInBand
yarn build
```

## Hardware and angle conventions

This repository is a **kinematic simulator**, not a dynamics simulator or servo controller. It does not model servo torque, electrical limits, collisions, mass/inertia, or ground friction, and it does not output PWM signals.

The hardware `stand`, `sit`, and `belly_touch` poses in the reference Python controller use servo command angles. They are not automatically the same as the simulator's `alpha`, `beta`, and `gamma` angles. A hardware mapping needs each joint's zero offset, direction (including any mirrored joints), and installed usable travel. A servo's advertised 270° travel should not be treated as a safe ±270° joint range; calibrate mechanical limits before using any simulated angles to drive hardware.
